This repository is used to track my progress in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C#**.  
I am preparing for my **OOP exam** and created this repository to practice and strengthen my understanding of OOP concepts through consistent coding.

Instead of focusing only on theory, this repository emphasizes **hands-on practice**. Each project is based on a set of requirements that I follow to implement and apply OOP principles in C#.

## Purpose

- Practice and reinforce OOP concepts in C#
    
- Prepare effectively for an upcoming OOP exam
    
- Improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills
    
- Track learning progress over time
    

## Repository Structure

- Each folder represents a **separate practice project**
    
- Every project is based on **requirements provided by ChatGPT**
    
- Projects increase gradually in difficulty
    
- Each task focuses on one or more OOP principles
    

## Concepts Covered

This repository includes practice related to:

- Classes and Objects
    
- Constructors
    
- Encapsulation
    
- Inheritance
    
- Polymorphism
    
- Abstraction
    
- Abstract Classes
    
- Interfaces
    
- Method Overriding
    
- Collections (e.g. `List<T>`)
    
- Basic real-world OOP modeling
    

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: C#
    
- Framework: .NET
    
- Application Type: Console Applications
    
- Development Environment: Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code
    

## Learning Approach

The goal of this repository is not perfection, but improvement.  
Some projects are simple, while others are intentionally more challenging to simulate exam-style questions.

This repository reflects my learning journey and continuous progress in OOP using C#.
