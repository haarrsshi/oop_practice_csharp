# Ticket System (OOP Practice)

This project is a small console application created to practice object-oriented programming concepts in C#.

The goal was to design a system that manages different types of support tickets while using inheritance and polymorphism correctly.

### Task Description
A company wants to manage support tickets.  
There are different types of tickets, but all tickets share some common information and behavior.

The system should:
- handle multiple ticket types
- store them together using a common base type
- display ticket information using polymorphism

### Key Concepts Practiced
- Abstract base classes
- Inheritance
- Method overriding
- Polymorphism using a list of the base type

### Notes
The focus of this task is on class design and structure, not on user input or UI.
