# Character Battle System (OOP Practice)

This project is a small game-style simulation created to practice abstraction, inheritance, and object interaction.

The focus is on clean separation of responsibilities between classes.

### Task Description
The system includes different types of characters that can attack and deal damage.
Each character calculates damage differently, but they are handled through a shared base type.

An enemy object receives damage and tracks its health.

The application should:
- allow different character types
- use polymorphism when characters attack
- manage health and alive/dead state

### Key Concepts Practiced
- Abstract classes
- Overridden methods
- Polymorphism using base-class lists
- Object interaction and state changes

### Notes
This project focuses on logic and structure, not realism or game mechanics.
