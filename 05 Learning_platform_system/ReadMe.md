# Learning Platform System (OOP Design Task)

This project focuses on object-oriented design rather than full implementation.
It is intended as a more complex practice task similar to real school OOP exams.

### Task Description
A digital learning platform supports different types of users and learning content.
Users interact with content and progress is tracked differently depending on the content type.

The system should:
- handle different user roles
- support multiple content types
- update and display progress correctly
- use polymorphism instead of type checks

### Key Concepts Practiced
- Identifying abstractions
- Polymorphism
- Responsibility separation
- Flexible and extensible design

### Notes
The emphasis of this task is on class structure and interaction.
No UI, database, or input handling is required.
