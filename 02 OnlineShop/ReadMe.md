# Vehicle Rental System (OOP Practice)

This project simulates a simple vehicle rental system to practice object-oriented design in C#.

Different vehicle types calculate rental prices in different ways but are managed through a common base class.

### Task Description
The system manages vehicles that can be rented and returned.
Each vehicle type calculates rental costs differently based on the rental duration.

The application should:
- support multiple vehicle types
- calculate rental prices using polymorphism
- track rental state correctly

### Key Concepts Practiced
- Abstract classes
- Method overriding
- Polymorphism
- State management
- Separation of calculation and output logic

### Notes
No real booking system is implemented. All behavior is demonstrated through console output.
